<h>IDEOLOGY</h>
<p>Ideology is the fundamental idea that forms the bedrock of thoughts, words and actions of the individuals of a community. The idea of being a nirankari is very simple, yet profound.
A nirankari is a ‘Sant’, trying to lead a simple saintly life at all times, in all places and among all relationships. Here, saintly does not mean dressing up in a specific way, rather embellishing our deeds with truth, love, tolerance, compassion and selfless service. A nirankari is guided towards selfless service by the mission’s first doctrine of Sewa, which does not mean helping or doing a favour; rather meeting out our responsibility being a human to serve others without seeking anything in return; it is indeed a blessing of god to have given us the intent, strength and intelligence to be able to serve others. We thus, thank the one who gives us an opportunity to serve. The mission and its devotees have been reaching out to the society through numerous such efforts and initiatives like blood donation camps, mass marriages, value-based centers of education, relief and rehabilitation of our brothers and sisters during natural calamities, tree plantation, cleanliness and social awareness drives etc. Even during the current Covid-19 crisis, the Mission contributed in numerous ways, all of which has been detailed in the Community Service section of the website.
We are ‘Nirankari’, which means we have been endowed with the spiritual truth and awareness of the eternal, formless, all-pervading almighty God by the grace of our Satguru; and with this one God, who may be addressed as Allah, Ishwar, Vitthal or Nirankar, our relationship is that of mindful remembrance. This one Nirankar becomes the source of our strength in times of weakness, our foundation of peace in times of turmoil, our fragrance of love in times of hatred and our key to moderation in times of ego and attachment. Our connect to Nirankar is effortless and smooth. All one has to do is recite the three lines of Simran and be aware of the Gyan (God-Realization) as bestowed by the Satguru. Here are the three magical lines that lead a soul to the sphere of nothingness:
“Tu Hi Nirankar” (Only YOU are the Formless Almighty God)
“Main Teri Sharan Haan” (I completely surrender unto YOU)
“Mainu Baksh Lo” (Forgive all my sins)
We are an all-embracing socio-spiritual dynamic and practical Mission, rather a movement dedicated to establish and maintain love, peace, equality, oneness and a world without walls, without any prejudice or discrimination. We strive to achieve this, first in our own lives and then in the lives of other brothers and sisters of the common humankind. This, we understand is possible only once we realize our true self by knowing god in the true and absolute manifestation through a living master, called Satguru (The dispeller of all darkness and the benefactor of eternal light). It becomes even more uncomplicated and manifest to experience, share and elevate the blissful state of mind, when we get to connect with other enlightened souls at the regularly organised Satsangs (Congregations) and Samagams (Large gatherings of devotees).</p>

<h>LEGACY</h>
<p>THE SATGURU TRADITION 
From time immemorial, the relationship of a Teacher and Disciple has been the most integral part of the process of learning and enlightenment. Imagine, even in the so-called modern times, we try and send our children to the best possible educational institution, so that they receive the most authentic knowledge and experience from a discerning set of teachers. Such is the importance of a true teacher, across all realms of time, subject and circumstance; highest of course when it relates to questions of soul, oversoul and purpose of life. The same being emphasized and endorsed by various saints, sages and scriptures from time to time.
The Nirankari Mission was also established on a similar foundation of a living Satguru. The tradition continues under the blissful aegis of Satguru Mata Sudiksha Ji Maharaj today.
Here is a brief introduction into the lives of the Masters of the Nirankari Mission, who have left behind a legacy of God-Realization and righteous living.</p>
<img src=https://www.nirankari.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Practical-Spritualityhover.jpg>
<h>
PRACTICAL SPIRITUALITY</h>
<p>No knowledge is complete till it comes to fruition through action. Likewise, spiritual discourse can also, rather only transform us if we follow the teachings of our Masters in our life. It is a thumb rule for every Nirankari devotee to follow the three-fold path of Sewa (Selfless Service), Simran (Mindful Remembrance of formless almighty God) and Satsang (company of enlightened beings) as a part of practical spirituality. But it also has a deeper root in the five basic principles or vows that a seeker agrees to follow in his life before attaining God-Knowledge from Satguru.

The five vows, which were presented by Baba Sajjan Singh Ji and were later formally approved as a precursor to receiving Brahmgyan by Shahenshah Baba Avtar Singh Ji, are nothing less than the preamble of Practical Spirituality. Baba Sajjan Singh Ji was the younger son of Baba Avtar Singh Ji. He was not only a prodigious young boy, but also exemplary in his vision for the Mission, having initiated a magazine of the Mission, which later became the monthly Sant Nirankari that we get to read today. We unfortunately lost him at an early age of 16 years due to an illness.

These five tenets, that guide a soul through a journey of self-introspection, emptying it of every dimension of ego, vanity, illusion and hatred, effectively form the foundation for receiving Gyan.

FIVE TENETS

The Mission preaches and expects its followers to abide by the following five pledges:
The body, mind and worldly possessions are a blessing of God; and should be used as such, without having any ego or vanity because of these.
One should not have ego or vanity because of one’s caste, creed, colour or race etc.
One should not discriminate or hate against anyone because of their food habits, dressing or lifestyle. 
One should not renounce family life to become a recluse and be a burden on others. Rather, one should fulfil all responsibilities of family and society.
One must not divulge God Knowledge as bestowed through the True Master without the consent and blessings of the Master.  

These five principles, as mentioned above, not only establish the foreground for receiving God-Knowledge, but also create a paraphernalia for its permanence in our conscious and sub-conscious existence. They act as moderators in times of excesses, tranquilizers in times of pain and mentors in times of illusion or fear. They in a way bring us back to zero, giving direction and peace to the mind, because zero is where the journey starts from, and zero is where it ends. 

The journey of Gyan as initiated by Baba Buta Singh Ji, took forward by Baba Avtar Singh Ji, upheld by the sacrifice of Baba Gurbachan Singh Ji, embellished by the love and grace of Baba Hardev Singh Ji, nurtured by the affection of Mata Savinder Hardev Ji, is being today carried forward with contemporary understanding of the same eternal message by Satguru Mata Sudiksha Ji Maharaj. 

THE SEVEN STARS
Though the Sant Nirankari Mission had started sowing seeds of Spiritual bliss from 1929, when Baba Buta Singh Ji Maharaj took on the mantle of reforming the society that was acutely divided on the basis of caste, colour, race and religion etc, it’s formal structure as an administrative body was formed in the year 1948 with the establishment of Sant Nirankari Mandal by Baba Avtar Singh Ji Maharaj. With an ideology based on values like love, compassion, tolerance and brotherhood, Shahenshah Ji selected seven devotees to become the functionaries of the first Executive Committee of the Sant Nirankari Mandal. Each one of them was an epitome of unflinching devotion to Satguru Nirankar, selfless service and compassion for all. Here are the names of the esteemed committee members who lived spirituality in the most practical way possible:
President- Shri Labh Singh Ji
Vice-President- Dr.Des Raj Ji
Secretary – Shri Ram Saran Ji
Vice- Secretary – Babu Mahadev Singh Ji
Publication in-charge – Shri Santokh Singh Ji
Treasurer – Shri Jugal Kishore Ji (a.k.a. Kabir Ji)
Langar In-charge – Shri Bhagat Ramchandar Ji
It is by the virtue of their views, words and actions that they were addressed as the Seven Stars of the Mission. 

THE SPIRITUAL TEXTS

Spiritual texts have played an integral role in the enlightenment of man. They act as beacons of knowledge and wisdom for generations to follow. The Nirankari ideology believes that instead of finding differences in the messages of the Holy Books, we should focus on the common solutions laid down by the spiritual masters, so as to make our lives, and incidentally the society and the world a better place to live. The two spiritual texts of the Mission continue to guide and enlighten human mind towards the path of salvation and righteousness.

SAMPURAN AVTAR BANI

Scripted and blessed by Baba Avtar Singh Ji, Sampuran Avtar Vani is a collection of 376 pious verses that gently take a seeker from the state of oblivion, illusion and fear to the most coveted identity of being One with One. The purpose with which Shanehshah Ji came up with this spiritual text was nothing else but to make the same old eternal truth understandable to everyone in simple day-to-day language. Originally written in Punjabi, the Sampuran Avtar Bani has now been translated into many regional and international languages including English, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali etc

SAMPURAN HARDEV BANI

A gift of Baba Hardev Singh Ji to humanity, the Sampuran Hardev Vani is a collection of 301 sacred verses, originally scripted in Hindi, that deal with many contemporary complex issues that disturb and distort the human psyche. The world knows for sure that Baba Hardev Singh Ji use to practically explain each and every dimension of a topic during his blissful discourses. Reading the Sampuran Hardev Bani makes us realise that we are actually listening to many of his pearls of knowledge and wisdom. 

THE CURRENT BLESSING

The present Satguru of the Sant Nirankari Mission, Satguru Mata Sudiksha Ji Maharaj has a deep focus on making the spiritual lessons practical for the life of its devotees, especially the youngsters. Many social initiatives and programs, that not only focus to bring a sociological change, but also condition the young sewadars with values of selfless service, compassion and nation building have been a direct blessing of Her Holiness Mata Ji. The Covid-19 crisis saw lakhs of our affected brothers and sisters across India and abroad being served food and other necessary items by the volunteers of the Mission. With the blessings of Satguru Mata Ji, the Mission also donated in the PM Cares Fund along with CM funds of some other states. 

Practical Spirituality is not always being in a perfect state of joy; rather it is being empowered to rise up with every fall to the state of balance and bliss. The continuous journey of Nirankari Youth Symp osiums has been driven essentially on the above motto; wherein the youth are free to ask anything and everything under the sky and find solutions to their everyday problems. Because if spirituality fails to answer our so-called ‘trivial’ problems, it turns ritualistic and mundane. At NYS, the youth of the Mission express their views and ideas in a variety of artforms and modules. Group Talks, Panel Discussions, Skits, Dances, Musical Performances etc make it look like a Spiritual Fest, wherein learning comes naturally.  

ONLINE PLATFORM

The Covid-19 lockdown forced the world to stay indoors. It has not been easy for many who were accustomed to meet and greet many people on daily basis. This emotional connect has been a source of joy and support for many, rather most of us. With the new norms and guidelines, when we were all worried about what would happen to our daily dose of Sangat, Satguru Mata Ji gave us the platform of Online Gyan Charcha Programs, which magically connected saints from across the world on the digital front. Devotees from even the remotest village of India to the urban centres of the western world were all connected to spiritual thoughts on regular basis. Satguru Mata Ji also blessed the Sunday congregations for almost 2-3 months with an array of virtuous topics ranging from Tolerance, Faith, Loving Devotion and Practical Spirituality etc. Even the 73rd Annual Samagam is being held virtually with the most valuable message of ‘Sthirta-The Eternal Stability’. All this establishes the fact that Her Holiness Mata Sudiksha Ji Maharaj wants a grassroot level change in the perception and attitude of the spiritual seekers, irrespective of age, gender, economic condition or cultural differences. 

MAGAZINES AND LITERATURE

The fortnightly and monthly magazines of the Mission have been a source of perennial learning for the masses for a long time. Ek Nazar, Sant Nirankari, Hansti Duniya are regular magazines of the Mission which are published in many languages. The Nirankari Publication has published a huge number of books in many languages over the last many decades that introduce the history, ideology and activities of the Mission along with presenting a generic view on many spiritual topics. Some texts also touch the social and scientific dimensions in a comprehensive way.</p>
<img src=https://www.nirankari.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/global-mission-2.png>
<h>GLOBAL MISSION</h>
<p>Over the last 90 years of its journey, the Sant Nirankari Mission has become a synonym of Oneness, love, peace, tolerance, selfless service and compassion. Though these virtues are frequently quoted by many, the Mission helps achieve them in our life through Practical Spirituality. It has been distinctly mentioned in various spiritual realms that knowing the Universal Truth is an infallible remedy to reduce stress, illusion, fear and ego; and that knowing this truth does not require a tedious journey, rather a mere seeking from the core of our consciousness. 

This pure quest for bliss becomes a catalyst to receive guidance and grace of the Satguru (The True Master) in the form of Brahmgyan (God-Knowledge) in no time. Millions of Nirankari devotees are a living testimony to the transformation that their life has experienced after receiving the spiritual bliss and awareness from Satguru. The Mission has also been instrumental in social upliftment in numerous ways, without any prejudice, living up to its basic ethos of One World-One Family.

The Sant Nirankari Mission started spreading the message of Love and Brotherhood across the world with the efforts and vision of Shahenshah Baba Avtar Singh Ji. This vision was taken forward by Baba Gurbachan Singh Ji, along with Nirankari Rajmata Ji, with branches of the Mission being setup in UK, US, Canada, Middle East, Australia and other parts of the world. The baton of Truth was taken ahead with even more momentum by Baba Hardev Singh Ji and Mata Savinder Ji, who embraced the world with their compassion and care. The Mission spread to more than 3000 branches in India and many hundreds in over 70 countries across the world. 

Many social initiatives have been taken in the last many decades in these centres including Blood Donation Camps, Food Drives, Social Awareness Programs, Cleanliness Drives, Tree Plantation Drives, Help and Support during Natural Calamities etc. These contributions have been acknowledged and honoured with numerous awards and recognitions over the years. The Mission has also been granted the general consultative status by the United Nations Organization.
