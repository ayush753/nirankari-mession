        <p>The Sant Nirankari Mission is an all embracing spiritual movement, cutting across all divisions of caste, color, and creed.The Mission seeks to reveal God, also known as Nirankar, to all human beings irrespective of their religious faith, sect, or community and thus liberate them from the shackles of ignorance, superstition, ritualism, and dogmatism in the name of devotion to God.It firmly believes that the realization of God is the real objective of human life and this can be achieved only through the benevolence of the living true master: the Satguru..The realization of God not only maintains balance between spirituality and materialism in day to day life, but also takes a person to the cherished achievement of brotherhood of mankind which leads to peaceful coexistence.</p>

      <p class="lead"> <b>History</b></p>
      <div class="container-History">
        <p>Nirankari Mission had its formal beginning on 25 May 1929, the day when Avtar Singh met Buta Singh.[1][2] In 1943, Baba Buta Singh passed on his position to Shenshah Baba Avtar Singh.[3] Baba Avtar Singh moved to Delhi after partition, where the "Sant Nirankari Mission" was created in 1948[4] (in 1947)[5] He was succeeded by his son Gurbachan Singh in 1962.[5]

Baba Gurbachan Singh was assassinated on 24 April 1980. With Baba Gurbachan Singh's last breath, he appointed his son Hardev Singh as the next Satguru.[5][6]

In 2016, Mata Savinder Hardev succeeded her husband Hardev Singh after a fatal accident.[7] In 2018, she declared her daughter Sudiksha Savinder Hardev as the sixth spiritual leader of the organization, days before she succumbed to her deteriorating health.[8]

Baba Buta Singh (1873–1943)
In 1929, Baba Buta Singh established the Sant Nirankari Mission. Before his death in 1943 at Kohmari, Baba Buta Singh handed over the responsibility of spreading the holy gyan to Shehnshah Baba Avtar Singh.[9]

Shehnshah Baba Avtar Singh (1899–1969)
Shehnshah Avtar Singh was born on 31 December 1899 in Latifal village of present-day Pakistan. In May 1929 he met Baba Buta Singh. In 1943, Buta Singh named Avtar Singh as successor before his death.

After the 1947 Indo-Pak partition, Baba Avtar Singh established the Sant Nirankari Mandal in Delhi, India. In 1962, Baba Avtar Singh entrusted it to Baba Gurbachan Singh. Shehnshah Avtar Singh became one with Nirankari on 17 September 1969.[10]

Satguru Baba Hardev Singh (1954–2016)

He was honored by the United Nations (U.N.O.) with special consultative status in 2012, which was later upgraded to general consultative status in 2018.[citation needed]

He died on 13 May 2016 in an automobile accident, when he was travelling to attend a spiritual gathering in Canada with both of his son-in-laws. One of them succumbed to his injuries. The other son in law was driving the vehicle when the accident occurred. Details are still vague around the exact cause of the accident.[4][12]
